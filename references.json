However, no study has used machine learning to estimate historical concentrations of PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm) at daily time scale in China at a national level.\nObjectives\nTo estimate daily concentrations of PM2.5 across China during 2005–2016.\nMethods\nDaily ground-level PM2.5 data were obtained from 1479 stations across China during 2014–2016. Data on aerosol optical depth (AOD), meteorological conditions and other predictors were downloaded. A random forests model (non-parametric machine learning algorithms) and two traditional regression models were developed to estimate ground-level PM2.5 concentrations. The best-fit model was then utilized to estimate the daily concentrations of PM2.5 across China with a resolution of 0.1° (≈10 km) during 2005–2016.\nResults\nThe daily random forests model showed much higher predictive accuracy than the other two traditional regression models, explaining the majority of spatial variability in daily PM2.5 [10-fold cross-validation (CV) R2 = 83%, root mean squared prediction error (RMSE) = 28.1 μg/m3]. At the monthly and annual time-scale, the explained variability of average PM2.5 increased up to 86% (RMSE = 10.7 μg/m3 and 6.9 μg/m3, respectively).\nConclusions\nTaking advantage of a novel application of modeling framework and the most recent ground-level PM2.5 observations, the machine learning method showed higher predictive ability than previous studies.\nCapsule\nRandom forests approach can be used to estimate historical exposure to PM2.5 in China with high accuracy.",

    "abstract": "Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) has been recognized as a key air pollutant that can influence population health risk, especially during extreme cases such as wildfires. Previous studies have applied geospatial techniques such as land use regression to map the ground-level PM2.5, while some recent studies have found that Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) derived from satellite images and machine learning techniques may be two elements that can improve spatiotemporal prediction. However, there has been a lack of studies evaluating use of different machine learning techniques with AOD datasets for mapping PM2.5, especially in areas with high spatiotemporal variability of PM2.5. In this study, we compared the performance of eight predictive algorithms with the use of multiple remote sensing datasets, including satellite-derived AOD data, for the prediction of ground-level PM2.5 concentration. Based on the results, Cubist, random forest and eXtreme Gradient Boosting were the algorithms with better performance, while Cubist was the best (CV-RMSE = 2.64 μg/m3, CV-R2 = 0.48). Variable importance analysis indicated that the predictors with the highest contributions in modelling were monthly AOD and elevation. In conclusion, appropriate selection of machine learning algorithms can improve ground-level PM2.5 estimation, especially for areas with nonlinear relationships between PM2.5 and predictors caused by complex terrain. Satellite-derived data such as AOD and land surface temperature (LST) can also be substitutes for traditional datasets retrieved from weather stations, especially for areas with sparse and uneven distribution of stations.",

    "volume": "80",
    "source": "ScienceDirect",
    "abstract": "In this study, principal components analysis (PCA) was performed to identify air pollution sources and tree based ensemble learning models were constructed to predict the urban air quality of Lucknow (India) using the air quality and meteorological databases pertaining to a period of five years. PCA identified vehicular emissions and fuel combustion as major air pollution sources. The air quality indices revealed the air quality unhealthy during the summer and winter. Ensemble models were constructed to discriminate between the seasonal air qualities, factors responsible for discrimination, and to predict the air quality indices. Accordingly, single decision tree (SDT), decision tree forest (DTF), and decision treeboost (DTB) were constructed and their generalization and predictive performance was evaluated in terms of several statistical parameters and compared with conventional machine learning benchmark, support vector machines (SVM). The DT and SVM models discriminated the seasonal air quality rendering misclassification rate (MR) of 8.32% (SDT); 4.12% (DTF); 5.62% (DTB), and 6.18% (SVM), respectively in complete data. The AQI and CAQI regression models yielded a correlation between measured and predicted values and root mean squared error of 0.901, 6.67 and 0.825, 9.45 (SDT); 0.951, 4.85 and 0.922, 6.56 (DTF); 0.959, 4.38 and 0.929, 6.30 (DTB); 0.890, 7.00 and 0.836, 9.16 (SVR) in complete data. The DTF and DTB models outperformed the SVM both in classification and regression which could be attributed to the incorporation of the bagging and boosting algorithms in these models. The proposed ensemble models successfully predicted the urban ambient air quality and can be used as effective tools for its management.",

    "abstract": "Countless learning tasks require dealing with sequential data. Image captioning, speech synthesis, and music generation all require that a model produce outputs that are sequences. In other domains, such as time series prediction, video analysis, and musical information retrieval, a model must learn from inputs that are sequences. Interactive tasks, such as translating natural language, engaging in dialogue, and controlling a robot, often demand both capabilities. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are connectionist models that capture the dynamics of sequences via cycles in the network of nodes. Unlike standard feedforward neural networks, recurrent networks retain a state that can represent information from an arbitrarily long context window. Although recurrent neural networks have traditionally been difficult to train, and often contain millions of parameters, recent advances in network architectures, optimization techniques, and parallel computation have enabled successful large-scale learning with them. In recent years, systems based on long short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional (BRNN) architectures have demonstrated ground-breaking performance on tasks as varied as image captioning, language translation, and handwriting recognition. In this survey, we review and synthesize the research that over the past three decades first yielded and then made practical these powerful learning models. When appropriate, we reconcile conflicting notation and nomenclature. Our goal is to provide a self-contained explication of the state of the art together with a historical perspective and references to primary research.",

    "abstract": "Because of their effectiveness in broad practical applications, LSTM networks have received a wealth of coverage in scientific journals, technical blogs, and implementation guides. However, in most articles, the inference formulas for the LSTM network and its parent, RNN, are stated axiomatically, while the training formulas are omitted altogether. In addition, the technique of \"unrolling\" an RNN is routinely presented without justification throughout the literature. The goal of this paper is to explain the essential RNN and LSTM fundamentals in a single document. Drawing from concepts in signal processing, we formally derive the canonical RNN formulation from differential equations. We then propose and prove a precise statement, which yields the RNN unrolling technique. We also review the difficulties with training the standard RNN and address them by transforming the RNN into the \"Vanilla LSTM\" network through a series of logical arguments. We provide all equations pertaining to the LSTM system together with detailed descriptions of its constituent entities. Albeit unconventional, our choice of notation and the method for presenting the LSTM system emphasizes ease of understanding. As part of the analysis, we identify new opportunities to enrich the LSTM system and incorporate these extensions into the Vanilla LSTM network, producing the most general LSTM variant to date. The target reader has already been exposed to RNNs and LSTM networks through numerous available resources and is open to an alternative pedagogical approach.

    "abstract": "Urban air pollution is the most serious environmental pollution problem in China. It not only causes serious losses to our economy, but also brings great hidden dangers to the physical and mental health of urban residents. Therefore, it is urgent to prevent and control air pollution. Air quality prediction and forecasting must be carried out to prevent air pollution. Timely and accurate air quality prediction can not only help urban managers to make scientific and effective preventive measures, but also provide more healthy and safe travel strategies for urban residents. China’s air monitoring system is gradually improving, its scale is expanding, and a large amount of air quality data is accumulating. With the rapid expansion of data scale, the traditional method of air quality prediction technology has been unable to deal with these massive data. In this paper, 365 sets of air pollutant data from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 in Shen Zhen were used as experimental objects. The improved SAPSO algorithm and PSO algorithm were used to optimize the parameters of SVM model and construct the air quality evaluation model. By analyzing the classification results of air quality grade, selecting relevant data and using partial least squares, the correlation coefficient matrix is established for the classification results, and the pollutant factors affecting air quality in Shenzhen are obtained. The results are ideal, which provides a scientific theoretical basis for the prevention and control of air pollution and urban management planning.",

    "abstract": "This study focused on the pattern recognition of Malaysian air quality based on the data obtained from the Malaysian Department of Environment (DOE). Eight air quality parameters in ten monitoring stations in Malaysia for 7 years (2005–2011) were gathered. Principal component analysis (PCA) in the environmetric approach was used to identify the sources of pollution in the study locations. The combination of PCA and artificial neural networks (ANN) was developed to determine its predictive ability for the air pollutant index (API). The PCA has identified that CH4, NmHC, THC, O3, and PM10 are the most significant parameters. The PCA-ANN showed better predictive ability in the determination of API with fewer variables, with R2 and root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.618 and 10.017, respectively. The work has demonstrated the importance of historical data in sampling plan strategies to achieve desired research objectives, as well as to highlight the possibility of determining the optimum number of sampling parameters, which in turn will reduce costs and time of sampling.",

    "abstract": "Land-use regression (LUR) is widely used for estimating within-urban variability in air pollution. While LUR has recently been extended to national and continental scales, these models are typically for long-term averages. Here we present NO2 surfaces for the continental United States with excellent spatial resolution (∼100 m) and monthly average concentrations for one decade. We investigate multiple potential data sources (e.g., satellite column and surface estimates, high- and standard-resolution satellite data, and a mechanistic model [WRF-Chem]), approaches to model building (e.g., one model for the whole country versus having separate models for urban and rural areas, monthly LURs versus temporal scaling of a spatial LUR), and spatial interpolation methods for temporal scaling factors (e.g., kriging versus inverse distance weighted). Our core approach uses NO2 measurements from U.S. EPA monitors (2000–2010) to build a spatial LUR and to calculate spatially varying temporal scaling factors. The model captures 82% of the spatial and 76% of the temporal variability (population-weighted average) of monthly mean NO2 concentrations from U.S. EPA monitors with low average bias (21%) and error (2.4 ppb). Model performance in absolute terms is similar near versus far from monitors, and in urban, suburban, and rural locations (mean absolute error 2–3 ppb); since low-density locations generally experience lower concentrations, model performance in relative terms is better near monitors than far from monitors (mean bias 3% versus 40%) and is better for urban and suburban locations (1–6%) than for rural locations (78%, reflecting the relatively clean conditions in many rural areas). During 2000–2010, population-weighted mean NO2 exposure decreased 42% (1.0 ppb [∼5.2%] per year), from 23.2 ppb (year 2000) to 13.5 ppb (year 2010). We apply our approach to all U.S. Census blocks in the contiguous United States to provide 132 months of publicly available, high-resolution NO2 concentration estimates.",

    "abstract": "Air pollution has become an important environmental issue in recent decades. Forecasts of air quality play an important role in warning people about and controlling air pollution. We used support vector regression (SVR) and random forest regression (RFR) to build regression models for predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Beijing and the nitrogen oxides (NOX) concentration in an Italian city, based on two publicly available datasets. The root-mean-square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (r), and coefficient of determination (R2) were used to evaluate the performance of the regression models. Experimental results showed that the SVR-based model performed better in the prediction of the AQI (RMSE = 7.666, R2 = 0.9776, and r = 0.9887), and the RFR-based model performed better in the prediction of the NOX concentration (RMSE = 83.6716, R2 = 0.8401, and r = 0.9180). This work also illustrates that combining machine learning with air quality prediction is an efficient and convenient way to solve some related environment problems.",

    "abstract": "Urban air pollution is the most serious environmental pollution problem in China. It not only causes serious losses to our economy, but also brings great hidden dangers to the physical and mental health of urban residents. Therefore, it is urgent to prevent and control air pollution. Air quality prediction and forecasting must be carried out to prevent air pollution. Timely and accurate air quality prediction can not only help urban managers to make scientific and effective preventive measures, but also provide more healthy and safe travel strategies for urban residents. China’s air monitoring system is gradually improving, its scale is expanding, and a large amount of air quality data is accumulating. With the rapid expansion of data scale, the traditional method of air quality prediction technology has been unable to deal with these massive data. In this paper, 365 sets of air pollutant data from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 in Shen Zhen were used as experimental objects. The improved SAPSO algorithm and PSO algorithm were used to optimize the parameters of SVM model and construct the air quality evaluation model. By analyzing the classification results of air quality grade, selecting relevant data and using partial least squares, the correlation coefficient matrix is established for the classification results, and the pollutant factors affecting air quality in Shenzhen are obtained. The results are ideal, which provides a scientific theoretical basis for the prevention and control of air pollution and urban management planning.",

    "abstract": "This study focused on the pattern recognition of Malaysian air quality based on the data obtained from the Malaysian Department of Environment (DOE). Eight air quality parameters in ten monitoring stations in Malaysia for 7 years (2005–2011) were gathered. Principal component analysis (PCA) in the environmetric approach was used to identify the sources of pollution in the study locations. The combination of PCA and artificial neural networks (ANN) was developed to determine its predictive ability for the air pollutant index (API). The PCA has identified that CH4, NmHC, THC, O3, and PM10 are the most significant parameters. The PCA-ANN showed better predictive ability in the determination of API with fewer variables, with R2 and root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.618 and 10.017, respectively. The work has demonstrated the importance of historical data in sampling plan strategies to achieve desired research objectives, as well as to highlight the possibility of determining the optimum number of sampling parameters, which in turn will reduce costs and time of sampling.",

    "abstract": "Land-use regression (LUR) is widely used for estimating within-urban variability in air pollution. While LUR has recently been extended to national and continental scales, these models are typically for long-term averages. Here we present NO2 surfaces for the continental United States with excellent spatial resolution (∼100 m) and monthly average concentrations for one decade. We investigate multiple potential data sources (e.g., satellite column and surface estimates, high- and standard-resolution satellite data, and a mechanistic model [WRF-Chem]), approaches to model building (e.g., one model for the whole country versus having separate models for urban and rural areas, monthly LURs versus temporal scaling of a spatial LUR), and spatial interpolation methods for temporal scaling factors (e.g., kriging versus inverse distance weighted). Our core approach uses NO2 measurements from U.S. EPA monitors (2000–2010) to build a spatial LUR and to calculate spatially varying temporal scaling factors. The model captures 82% of the spatial and 76% of the temporal variability (population-weighted average) of monthly mean NO2 concentrations from U.S. EPA monitors with low average bias (21%) and error (2.4 ppb). Model performance in absolute terms is similar near versus far from monitors, and in urban, suburban, and rural locations (mean absolute error 2–3 ppb); since low-density locations generally experience lower concentrations, model performance in relative terms is better near monitors than far from monitors (mean bias 3% versus 40%) and is better for urban and suburban locations (1–6%) than for rural locations (78%, reflecting the relatively clean conditions in many rural areas). During 2000–2010, population-weighted mean NO2 exposure decreased 42% (1.0 ppb [∼5.2%] per year), from 23.2 ppb (year 2000) to 13.5 ppb (year 2010). We apply our approach to all U.S. Census blocks in the contiguous United States to provide 132 months of publicly available, high-resolution NO2 concentration estimates.",

    "abstract": "Air pollution has become an important environmental issue in recent decades. Forecasts of air quality play an important role in warning people about and controlling air pollution. We used support vector regression (SVR) and random forest regression (RFR) to build regression models for predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Beijing and the nitrogen oxides (NOX) concentration in an Italian city, based on two publicly available datasets. The root-mean-square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (r), and coefficient of determination (R2) were used to evaluate the performance of the regression models. Experimental results showed that the SVR-based model performed better in the prediction of the AQI (RMSE = 7.666, R2 = 0.9776, and r = 0.9887), and the RFR-based model performed better in the prediction of the NOX concentration (RMSE = 83.6716, R2 = 0.8401, and r = 0.9180). This work also illustrates that combining machine learning with air quality prediction is an efficient and convenient way to solve some related environment problems.",

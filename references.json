    "source": "arxiv.org",
    "abstract": "Countless learning tasks require dealing with sequential data. Image\ncaptioning, speech synthesis, and music generation all require that a model\nproduce outputs that are sequences. In other domains, such as time series\nprediction, video analysis, and musical information retrieval, a model must\nlearn from inputs that are sequences. Interactive tasks, such as translating\nnatural language, engaging in dialogue, and controlling a robot, often demand\nboth capabilities. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are connectionist models\nthat capture the dynamics of sequences via cycles in the network of nodes.\nUnlike standard feedforward neural networks, recurrent networks retain a state\nthat can represent information from an arbitrarily long context window.\nAlthough recurrent neural networks have traditionally been difficult to train,\nand often contain millions of parameters, recent advances in network\narchitectures, optimization techniques, and parallel computation have enabled\nsuccessful large-scale learning with them. In recent years, systems based on\nlong short-term memory (LSTM) and bidirectional (BRNN) architectures have\ndemonstrated ground-breaking performance on tasks as varied as image\ncaptioning, language translation, and handwriting recognition. In this survey,\nwe review and synthesize the research that over the past three decades first\nyielded and then made practical these powerful learning models. When\nappropriate, we reconcile conflicting notation and nomenclature. Our goal is to\nprovide a self-contained explication of the state of the art together with a\nhistorical perspective and references to primary research.",

    "source": "arxiv.org",
    "abstract": "Because of their effectiveness in broad practical applications, LSTM networks\nhave received a wealth of coverage in scientific journals, technical blogs, and\nimplementation guides. However, in most articles, the inference formulas for\nthe LSTM network and its parent, RNN, are stated axiomatically, while the\ntraining formulas are omitted altogether. In addition, the technique of\n\"unrolling\" an RNN is routinely presented without justification throughout the\nliterature. The goal of this paper is to explain the essential RNN and LSTM\nfundamentals in a single document. Drawing from concepts in signal processing,\nwe formally derive the canonical RNN formulation from differential equations.\nWe then propose and prove a precise statement, which yields the RNN unrolling\ntechnique. We also review the difficulties with training the standard RNN and\naddress them by transforming the RNN into the \"Vanilla LSTM\" network through a\nseries of logical arguments. We provide all equations pertaining to the LSTM\nsystem together with detailed descriptions of its constituent entities. Albeit\nunconventional, our choice of notation and the method for presenting the LSTM\nsystem emphasizes ease of understanding. As part of the analysis, we identify\nnew opportunities to enrich the LSTM system and incorporate these extensions\ninto the Vanilla LSTM network, producing the most general LSTM variant to date.\nThe target reader has already been exposed to RNNs and LSTM networks through\nnumerous available resources and is open to an alternative pedagogical\napproach. A Machine Learning practitioner seeking guidance for implementing our\nnew augmented LSTM model in software for experimentation and research will find\nthe insights and derivations in this tutorial valuable as well.",

    "abstract": "Urban air pollution is the most serious environmental pollution problem in China. It not only causes serious losses to our economy, but also brings great hidden dangers to the physical and mental health of urban residents. Therefore, it is urgent to prevent and control air pollution. Air quality prediction and forecasting must be carried out to prevent air pollution. Timely and accurate air quality prediction can not only help urban managers to make scientific and effective preventive measures, but also provide more healthy and safe travel strategies for urban residents. Chinaâ€™s air monitoring system is gradually improving, its scale is expanding, and a large amount of air quality data is accumulating. With the rapid expansion of data scale, the traditional method of air quality prediction technology has been unable to deal with these massive data. In this paper, 365 sets of air pollutant data from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 in Shen Zhen were used as experimental objects. The improved SAPSO algorithm and PSO algorithm were used to optimize the parameters of SVM model and construct the air quality evaluation model. By analyzing the classification results of air quality grade, selecting relevant data and using partial least squares, the correlation coefficient matrix is established for the classification results, and the pollutant factors affecting air quality in Shenzhen are obtained. The results are ideal, which provides a scientific theoretical basis for the prevention and control of air pollution and urban management planning.",

    "abstract": "This study focused on the pattern recognition of Malaysian air quality based on the data obtained from the Malaysian Department of Environment (DOE). Eight air quality parameters in ten monitoring stations in Malaysia for 7Â years (2005â€“2011) were gathered. Principal component analysis (PCA) in the environmetric approach was used to identify the sources of pollution in the study locations. The combination of PCA and artificial neural networks (ANN) was developed to determine its predictive ability for the air pollutant index (API). The PCA has identified that CH4, NmHC, THC, O3, and PM10 are the most significant parameters. The PCA-ANN showed better predictive ability in the determination of API with fewer variables, with R2 and root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.618 and 10.017, respectively. The work has demonstrated the importance of historical data in sampling plan strategies to achieve desired research objectives, as well as to highlight the possibility of determining the optimum number of sampling parameters, which in turn will reduce costs and time of sampling.",

    "abstract": "Land-use regression (LUR) is widely used for estimating within-urban variability in air pollution. While LUR has recently been extended to national and continental scales, these models are typically for long-term averages. Here we present NO2 surfaces for the continental United States with excellent spatial resolution (âˆ¼100 m) and monthly average concentrations for one decade. We investigate multiple potential data sources (e.g., satellite column and surface estimates, high- and standard-resolution satellite data, and a mechanistic model [WRF-Chem]), approaches to model building (e.g., one model for the whole country versus having separate models for urban and rural areas, monthly LURs versus temporal scaling of a spatial LUR), and spatial interpolation methods for temporal scaling factors (e.g., kriging versus inverse distance weighted). Our core approach uses NO2 measurements from U.S. EPA monitors (2000â€“2010) to build a spatial LUR and to calculate spatially varying temporal scaling factors. The model captures 82% of the spatial and 76% of the temporal variability (population-weighted average) of monthly mean NO2 concentrations from U.S. EPA monitors with low average bias (21%) and error (2.4 ppb). Model performance in absolute terms is similar near versus far from monitors, and in urban, suburban, and rural locations (mean absolute error 2â€“3 ppb); since low-density locations generally experience lower concentrations, model performance in relative terms is better near monitors than far from monitors (mean bias 3% versus 40%) and is better for urban and suburban locations (1â€“6%) than for rural locations (78%, reflecting the relatively clean conditions in many rural areas). During 2000â€“2010, population-weighted mean NO2 exposure decreased 42% (1.0 ppb [âˆ¼5.2%] per year), from 23.2 ppb (year 2000) to 13.5 ppb (year 2010). We apply our approach to all U.S. Census blocks in the contiguous United States to provide 132 months of publicly available, high-resolution NO2 concentration estimates.",

    "abstract": "Air pollution has become an important environmental issue in recent decades. Forecasts of air quality play an important role in warning people about and controlling air pollution. We used support vector regression (SVR) and random forest regression (RFR) to build regression models for predicting the Air Quality Index (AQI) in Beijing and the nitrogen oxides (NOX) concentration in an Italian city, based on two publicly available datasets. The root-mean-square error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (r), and coefficient of determination (R2) were used to evaluate the performance of the regression models. Experimental results showed that the SVR-based model performed better in the prediction of the AQI (RMSE = 7.666, R2 = 0.9776, and r = 0.9887), and the RFR-based model performed better in the prediction of the NOX concentration (RMSE = 83.6716, R2 = 0.8401, and r = 0.9180). This work also illustrates that combining machine learning with air quality prediction is an efficient and convenient way to solve some related environment problems.",
